Temporal NDVI Analysis for Coffee Crop Classification Using SATVeg and Machine Learning
This project implements a workflow to classify agricultural samples as either coffee or non-coffee using temporal NDVI data extracted from SATVeg, combined with a machine learning classification approach.

Features
Loads NDVI time series datasets from coffee and non-coffee crop samples
Applies a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between coffee and non-coffee patterns
Validates results using independent samples from established coffee farms
Supports integration with MODIS-based SATVeg data

Technologies
Language: Python 3
Platform: Google Colab
Dependencies: pandas | numpy | scikit-learn | matplotlib | seaborn | shap | SciPy

Installation and Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Open in Colab notebook file or Python platform
Upload the dataset and validation samples as required.
Run the notebook cells in sequence to train, validate, and visualize the model results.
