Project: Temporal NDVI Analysis for Coffee Crop Classification Using SATVeg and Machine Learning
Context: This project implements a workflow to classify agricultural samples as either coffee or non-coffee using temporal NDVI data extracted from SATVeg, combined with a machine learning classification approach.

Features: 
NDVI time series dataset from coffee and non-coffee crop samples: satveg_coffee_merged_ndvi.xlsx
Pre-processing: Dataset Pre-Processing code
Random Forest classifier algorithm: Random Forest Classification code
Code to validate algorithm: RF Test code
Samples to validate algorithm (optional): validation data.zip
Supports integration with MODIS-based SATVeg data

Technologies
Language: Python 3
Platform: Google Colab
Dependencies: pandas | numpy | scikit-learn | matplotlib | seaborn | shap

Installation and Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Open in Colab notebook file or Python platform
Upload the dataset and validation samples as required.
Run the notebook cells in sequence to train, validate, and visualize the model results.
